# 🗂️ Apache Atlas & Hadoop Integration Guide

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of configuration files, scripts, and documentation necessary to **successfully integrate Apache Atlas with a Hadoop ecosystem**. It is the result of hands-on experience implementing data governance solutions for a Big Data environment.

## 📌 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to serve as a **reference implementation** for setting up and troubleshooting Apache Atlas with components like **HDFS**, **Hive**, **Sqoop**, and **Kafka**, using tools such as **Ansible** and **custom shell/Python scripts**.

## 📁 Contents

- `HDFS INTEGRATION WITH APACHE ATLAS.pdf`  
  → Documentation on integrating HDFS with Apache Atlas.

- `Manual Sqoop-Atlas Integration Configuration.docx`  
  → Step-by-step guide to configure metadata capture from Sqoop.

- `Script to configure Atlas Hive hook by transfer...`  
  → Bash script to automate Hive hook integration.

- `atlas-application.properties.txt`, `atlas-env.sh.txt`  
  → Key configuration files for the Apache Atlas runtime.

- `configuration apache atlas sur un cluster hadoop.docx`  
  → Guide (in French) for setting up Atlas in a clustered environment.

- `configure atlas.docx`, `atlas_hive cluster.docx`  
  → Additional setup documentation and cluster-specific notes.

- `debugging solution for hbase shutdown.docx`  
  → Troubleshooting tips for common HBase shutdown issues.

- `server.properties.sh(slaves) to configure kafka.txt`  
  → Kafka configuration to support metadata exchange.

## 🔧 Technologies Involved

- **Apache Atlas**
- **Apache Hadoop (HDFS, Hive, Sqoop, Kafka)**
- **Ansible**
- **Shell scripting**
- **PostgreSQL (as metadata store)**

## 🧠 Usage

This repo is intended for:
- DevOps engineers configuring governance in Big Data platforms
- Data engineers needing traceability and metadata management
- Developers integrating Atlas with Hadoop services

> 📌 **Note:** Always test configurations in a non-production environment before deployment.
